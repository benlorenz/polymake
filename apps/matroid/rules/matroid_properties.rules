# @category Advanced properties
# The G-invariant of the matroid (see [Derksen: Symmetric and quasi-symmetric functions associated to polymatroids, J. Algebr. Comb. 30 (2009), 43-86])
# We use the formulation by Bonin and Kung in [Bonin, Kung: The G-invariant and catenary data of a matroid (2015)]:
# The G-invariant is an element of the free abelian group over all (n,r)-sequences (where n = [[N_ELEMENTS]] and r = [[RANK]]), i.e. 0/1-sequences (r_1,...,r_n), where exactly r entries are 1. We identify each such sequence with its support, i.e. the set of entries equal to 1, so the G-invariant can be represented as a map which takes
# an r-set to the coefficient of the corresponding (n,r)-sequence.
# The formal definition goes as follows: For each permutation p on n, we define a sequence r(p) = (r_1,...,r_n)
# by r_1 = rank({p(1)}) and r_j = rank( {p(1),...,p(j)}) - rank( {p(1),...,p(j-1)}). Then
# G(M) := sum_p r(p), where the sum runs over all permutations p.

# @category Advanced properties
# This is an equivalent characterization of the [[G_INVARIANT]] given by Bonin and Kung ([Bonin, Kung: The G-invariant and catenary data of a matroid (2015)]).
# It lives in the free abelian group over all (n,r)-compositions (where n = [[N_ELEMENTS]] and r = [[RANK]]).
# Those are sequences (a0,...,ar) with a0 >= 0, a_j > 0 for j > 0 and sum a_i = n
# For each maximal chain of flats F0,...,Fr = E of M, the corresponding composition is a0 = |F0| and a_i = |Fi \ Fi-1| for i > 0.
# For a composition a, let v(M,a) be the number of maximal chains of flats with composition a. Then
# G(M) := sum_a v(M,a) * a, where the sum runs over all compositions a.
