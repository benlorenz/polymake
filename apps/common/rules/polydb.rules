# @topic category any/Database
# Here you can find the functions to access the polymake database.

# @topic category functions/Database Admin
# These are administrative functions. You need admin access to the database for these.
#
# This category also contains functions that I want to hide from the public because they are not yet completely presentable.

# @topic category functions/Database Write Access
# These are the functions to insert and update objects. You need write access to the database for these.
